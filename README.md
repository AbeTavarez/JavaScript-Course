# Introduction To JavaScript

## What's JavaScript?

- JavaScript or JS for short, is a high level programming language. 
- JS is used to add functionality to websites or web applications, create server-side applications, mobile and desktop applications, and more!
- For the first part of this course we'll be working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create web applications.  

## How do we get JavaScript?

- JavaScript is native to web browsers, meaning all browsers already have JavaScript in them. 
- We also would like to run JavaScript outside the browser right?, therefore we'll install NodeJS.
- NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment. This environment (NodeJS), allows you to run JavaScript on multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, Mac, Unix, and more...

## Setup

These are the tools we'll be using on this course, please go ahead and install these tools:

- NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- VS Code Editor (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Chrome Browser (https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Windows Users ONLY!

- GitBash (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

# Next Step: Intro to the Chrome Browser -> Dev Tools

 - Open your Chrome Browser and navigate to any website, I'll navigate to developer.mozilla.org
 - Open the dev tools by right clicking anywhere and click Inspect at the bottom of the menu.
 - Now that we have our dev tools open let's look at all some of the different tabs we have available: 

    1. Elements -> this tab allows you to view and work with the HTML and CSS of the current page.
    2. Console -> this tab allows you to run JavaScript code. We'll be using it a lot!
    3. Sources -> this tab allows you to debug run and save snippets of JavaScript.
    4. Network -> this tab allows you to view and debug network activities.
    5. Application -> this tab allows you to work with all other resources that are loaded from this application, this tab is a bit advance but we'll get here later.
