# Introduction To JavaScript

## What's JavaScript?

- JavaScript or JS for short, is a high level programming language. 
- JS is used to add functionality to websites or web applications, create server-side applications, mobile and desktop applications, and more!
- For the first part of this course we'll be working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create web applications.  

## How do we get JavaScript?

- JavaScript is native to web browsers, meaning all browsers already have JavaScript in them. 
- We also would like to run JavaScript outside the browser right?, therefore we'll install NodeJS.
- NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment. This environment (NodeJS), allows you to run JavaScript on multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, Mac, Unix, and more...
