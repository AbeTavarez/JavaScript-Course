# Introduction To JavaScript

## What's JavaScript?

- JavaScript is a programming language used to add functionality to websites, create web applications, create server side applications, create mobile and desktop applications, and more!

## How do we get JavaScript?

- JavaScript is native to web browsers, meaning JavaScript is already in any browser. 
- We also would like to run JavaScript out side the browser, therefore we'll install NodeJS.
- NodeJS is an open source server environment that can run on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac, Unix, and more...)
