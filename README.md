Beginners JavaScript Course

# Section 1: Introduction To JavaScript 

### What's JavaScript?

- JavaScript or JS for short, is a high level programming language. 
- JS is used to add functionality to websites or web applications, create server-side applications, mobile apps, desktop applications, and more!
- For the first part of this course we'll be working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create web applications.  

### How do we get JavaScript?

- JavaScript is native to web browsers, meaning all browsers already have JavaScript in them. 
- We also would like to run JavaScript outside the browser right?, therefore we'll install NodeJS.
- NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment. This environment (NodeJS), allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser on multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, Mac, Unix, and more...

### Setup

These are the tools we'll be using on this course, please go ahead and install these FREE/Open Source tools:

 ðŸŽ¥ [Watch a video on how to install these tools!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb9-Q1E0yZU)

- Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - Note: If you're using Windows you will also get the GitBash Terminal installed together with GIT.
- NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- VS Code Editor (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Chrome Browser (https://www.google.com/chrome/)

## Next Step: Intro to the Chrome Browser -> Dev Tools

 - Open your Chrome Browser and navigate to any website, I'll navigate to developer.mozilla.org
 - Open the dev tools by right clicking anywhere and click Inspect at the bottom of the menu.
 - Now that we have our dev tools open let's look at all some of the different tabs we have available: 

1. Elements -> this tab allows you to view and work with the HTML and CSS of the current page.

2. Console -> this tab allows you to run JavaScript code. We'll be using it a lot!

3. Sources -> this tab allows you to debug run and save snippets of JavaScript.

4. Network -> this tab allows you to view and debug network activities.

5. Application -> this tab allows you to work with all other resources that are loaded from this application, this tab is a bit advance but we'll get here later.


## Next Step: Intro to VS Code 

  - Create a new Folder for our course.
  - Open the new folder with VS Code.
  - Create a new folder -> Intro.
  - Create a HTML Template file inside our new Intro folder.
  - Install Live Server.
  - Create and add a CSS file inside our new Intro folder.
    - add some CSS
  - Create and add a Javascript file inside our new Intro folder.
    - run some JavaScript

## Next Step: Basic Terminal Commands

In this section we'll learn some of the basic terminal commands.

These commands are compose of the commands itself, any options, and argument.

Examples:

  Here is a commands with no options just the command and the argument:
    * cd Desktop

  Here is a command with an option and argument:
    * ls -l Desktop 
 
ðŸŽ¥ [Watch a video on how to start using the terminal!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqYoE5jVF4U)

  Here is a list of the commands we'll be using in the upcoming sections:
  
  Command | Meaning | Example
  | :--- | :--- | :---
  pwd | print working directory | pwd
  cd | change directory | cd Desktop
  ls | list content | ls or ls [directory name]
  mkdir | make directory | mkdir [new directory name]
  touch | create file | touch [new file name]

## Next Step: Intro to the Terminal, Git and GitHub

 - Open a new terminal.
 - Initiate Git.
 - Create a Github Account and Repository.
 - Add, Commit and Push.
 - Look at our first Github commit/contribution!
