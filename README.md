# Introduction To JavaScript

## What's JavaScript?

- `JavaScript (JS)` is a high level programming language. 
- JS used to add functionality to websites, create web applications, create server-side applications, create mobile and desktop applications, and more!

## How do we get JavaScript?

- JavaScript is native to web browsers, meaning JavaScript is already in any browser. 
- We also would like to run JavaScript outside the browser, therefore we'll install NodeJS.
- `NodeJS` is an open source server environment that can run on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac, Unix, and more...)

## Setup

These are the tools we'll be using on this course:

- NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- VS Code Editor (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Chrome Browser (https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- MDN Mozilla Developer Network (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)
